# XbeeInteraction

This code was written to run as a background service on a Raspberry Pi to communicate with greenhouse hardware via Xbee wireless radios. Its a bit wonky but it gets the job done. (also the database credentials are invalid, and I know I should have used environment variables, but I never got around to it oops)
